This project is divided in two sub-projects. The main one (/core/) is an e-commerce website developed in PHP and JavaScript. The second one(/loyaltyscheme/) is an independant website responsible for handling the core's loyalty scheme. These two websites together were presented as the final project of the module Team Project on 2016, at University of West London, UK.
